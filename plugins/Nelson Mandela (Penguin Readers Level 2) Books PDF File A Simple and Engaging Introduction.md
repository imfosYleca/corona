Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 in a small village in South Africa. He belonged to the Thembu royal family, but he was not interested in becoming a chief. He wanted to study law and help his people fight for their rights. He joined the African National Congress (ANC), a political party that opposed apartheid. He became a leader of the ANC and organized peaceful protests and campaigns against the racist laws of the white minority government.
 
In 1962, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was sent to Robben Island, a harsh prison where he had to work in a quarry and sleep on the floor. He suffered from isolation, abuse and illness, but he never lost his dignity and courage. He continued to study and write, and he inspired other prisoners and activists with his words and actions. He also secretly negotiated with the government to end apartheid and violence.
 
In 1990, after 27 years in prison, Mandela was finally released. He was welcomed by millions of people who celebrated his freedom and admired his leadership. He became the president of the ANC and worked with President F.W. de Klerk to end apartheid and create a new constitution for South Africa. In 1994, he was elected as the first black president of South Africa in a historic democratic election. He formed a government of national unity and reconciliation, and promoted peace, justice and human rights for all.
  
Nelson Mandela retired from politics in 1999, but he remained a global icon of freedom and peace. He founded the Nelson Mandela Foundation, a charity that supports various causes such as education, health and human rights. He also supported the fight against HIV/AIDS, a disease that affected millions of people in South Africa and around the world. He received many awards and honors for his achievements, such as the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Order of Canada.
