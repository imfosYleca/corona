## Step 1: Download the ISO file
 
The first step is to download the ISO file of Autodesk AutoCAD 2016 from a reliable source. An ISO file is an image of a CD or DVD that contains all the files and folders of the software. You can download the ISO file of Autodesk AutoCAD 2016 from the following link: [^1^]. This link is from a community website that provides free downloads of various software. The file size is about 5.4 GB and it contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Autodesk AutoCAD 2016.
 
## Step 2: Mount or burn the ISO file
 
The next step is to mount or burn the ISO file to a CD or DVD. Mounting means creating a virtual drive on your computer that can read the ISO file as if it were a physical disc. Burning means writing the ISO file to a blank CD or DVD that can be inserted into your optical drive.
