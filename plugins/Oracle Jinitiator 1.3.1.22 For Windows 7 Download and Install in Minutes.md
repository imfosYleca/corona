Oracle Jinitiator is a legacy plug-in that was developed by Oracle to support older versions of Oracle Forms applications. However, it is no longer supported by Oracle and may not work properly on newer browsers and operating systems. Therefore, it is recommended that you upgrade your Oracle Forms applications to the latest version that uses Java Web Start technology instead of Oracle Jinitiator. Java Web Start is a more secure and reliable way to launch Java applications over the web without requiring a browser plug-in. It also supports a wider range of platforms and browsers than Oracle Jinitiator.
