If you are looking for a thrilling and terrifying experience, you might want to check out Escape from the Giant Insect Lab, a new horror game that was released on Steam last week. The game is developed by Indie Studio Bug Out, and it is their first project.
 
The game is set in a secret laboratory where experiments on giant insects have gone horribly wrong. You play as a survivor who has to find a way out of the lab while avoiding being eaten by the monstrous creatures. The game features realistic graphics, immersive sound effects, and a variety of weapons and items to help you survive.

The game has four difficulty levels, ranging from easy to nightmare. The higher the difficulty, the more aggressive and intelligent the insects become. The game also has a random mode, where the layout of the lab and the location of the insects are different each time you play. This adds replay value and challenge to the game.
 
The game is not for the faint of heart, as it contains graphic violence, gore, and jump scares. The game also has some bugs and glitches that might affect the gameplay. However, the developers have promised to fix them in the next update (ver 1.01 zip), which will also add new features and content to the game.
 
Escape from the Giant Insect Lab is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you scream in fear. If you are a fan of horror games, you should definitely give it a try. You can download it from Steam for $9.99.
  
The game has a simple but engaging story that unfolds through notes, audio logs, and cutscenes. You learn more about the origin of the lab, the experiments, and the fate of the other survivors as you explore the facility. The game also has multiple endings, depending on your choices and actions throughout the game.
