## Is Badoo Credits Generator V1.1 safe and legit?
  
The short answer is no. Badoo Credits Generator V1.1 is not a safe or legit tool to get free credits on Badoo. Here are some reasons why you should avoid using it:

Using Badoo Credits Generator V1.1 is a violation of the terms and conditions of Badoo, which prohibit the use of any unauthorized software or methods to manipulate the app or its services. By using this tool, you are risking your account being banned or suspended by Badoo.
- It is a scam and a malware. The program does not actually generate any credits for your account. Instead, it may infect your device with viruses, spyware, or ransomware that can harm your data and privacy. The program may also steal your personal information, such as your username, password, email address, or credit card details, and use them for fraudulent purposes.
- It is a waste of time and money. The program may require you to complete a captcha or a survey before you can access your credits. However, these are just tricks to make you click on ads or sign up for paid services that do not benefit you at all. You may end up spending more money than you would have if you had bought credits from Badoo directly.
